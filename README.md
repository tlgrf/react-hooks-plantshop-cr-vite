# Plantsy

## Description

This is Plantsy, a simple React app I built for managing a plant store admin panel. It hooks up to a fake JSON backend so you can:

- **Fetch** and display all available plants when the page loads 
- **Add** new plants via using a form (they'll get saved in the backend)
- **Toggle** plant stock status locally ("In Stock" / "Out of Stock")  
- **Search** and filter plants by name in real time
